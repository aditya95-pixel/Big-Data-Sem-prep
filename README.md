### 26(a) Function of Management in IoT Systems
### [(CO4)(Analyse/HOCQ)]

In IoT systems, **management functions** play a crucial role in ensuring efficient operation, security, and scalability. The key functions include:

1. **Device Management** - Monitors and maintains IoT devices, including provisioning, authentication, and firmware updates.
2. **Data Management** - Handles data collection, storage, and processing from IoT devices.
3. **Network Management** - Ensures proper communication between devices, cloud services, and edge computing nodes.
4. **Security Management** - Implements authentication, encryption, and anomaly detection to prevent unauthorized access.
5. **Energy Management** - Optimizes power consumption for battery-operated IoT devices.
6. **Fault Management** - Detects and resolves issues in real-time to maintain system reliability.

Efficient IoT management ensures **seamless connectivity, improved performance, and enhanced security** in distributed networks.

### 26(b) Role of Subscribers in the Publish-Subscribe Model
### [(CO6)(Remember/LOCQ)]

In the **Publish-Subscribe (Pub-Sub) Model**, **subscribers** play a vital role in receiving relevant data. Their key roles include:

1. **Listening for Messages** - Subscribers register to specific topics of interest and receive only relevant messages.
2. **Decoupling from Publishers** - Subscribers do not communicate directly with publishers; instead, they rely on a broker for message distribution.
3. **Handling Events** - When a publisher sends a message, the broker ensures it reaches all relevant subscribers.
4. **Asynchronous Communication** - Subscribers receive messages asynchronously, making the system scalable and efficient.
5. **Filtering Data** - Subscribers can apply filters to process only necessary messages, reducing bandwidth usage.

Subscribers enable **efficient, scalable, and flexible communication in IoT and distributed systems** by reducing direct dependencies between components.

### 26(c) Functions of Queues in Push-Pull Communication Model
### [(CO6)(Apply/IOCQ)]

In the **Push-Pull Communication Model**, **message queues** manage data flow between producers and consumers. Their primary functions include:

1. **Decoupling Producers and Consumers** - Queues act as an intermediary, allowing producers to send messages without waiting for consumers.
2. **Load Balancing** - Messages are stored in a queue until a consumer is ready, preventing system overload.
3. **Message Persistence** - Queues store messages temporarily, ensuring reliable delivery even if a consumer is unavailable.
4. **Prioritization** - Some queue implementations allow prioritizing urgent messages for faster processing.
5. **Scalability** - Multiple consumers can pull messages from the queue, improving system performance under high loads.
6. **Fault Tolerance** - If a consumer fails, messages remain in the queue until successfully processed by another consumer.

This model is widely used in **distributed systems, cloud services, and IoT networks** to improve communication reliability and efficiency.
